# Get shit done
No more procrastination.

## How it works?
The extension will "**block**" some specific sites by turning them to a black background with a random motivating quote.

## Features
- Currently support sites: Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, TikTok (block forever, can be unblocked by turning off the extension ~~permanently~~ **temporarily**.)
- Can manage specific sites to block in `manifest.json`, using [match patterns](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/match_patterns/)
- Can block sites in a specific time range, or block forever
Â  Â - `getshitdone.js`: all day except from 6 AM to 10 AM
Â  Â - `getshitdone-night.js`: from 10 PM today to 6 AM tomorrow
Â  Â - `getshitdone-forever.js`: as the name implies, **block forever**
- Have multiple motivational quotes or you can create your own
- And more, if you know JavaScript, there are lots of things you can do with this extension ðŸ˜‰
