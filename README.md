# Get shit done
This browser extension will "**block**" some specific sites by turning them to a black background with 👁️ (Yes, I am watching you 🙂).

## Features
- Currently support sites: Facebook, Messenger, TikTok
- Can manage specific sites to block in `manifest.json`, using [match patterns](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/match_patterns/)
- Can block sites in specific time ranges, or block forever (can be unblocked by turning off the extension ~~permanently~~ **temporarily**)
- Can display your favorite motivational quotes
- And more, if you know JavaScript, there are lots of things you can do with this extension 😉

## Todo/Idea
- Redirect to specific website if blocking
- Convert to userscripts, make it easier to manage for different sites
- [ ] Only allow limit time for each site, using cookie to store time spent
